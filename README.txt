First player to 10 points wins.
Obtain points by picking up powerups (treasure chests for yellow player and skulls for red player).
Each player can throw a weapon and if it hits the other player they lose 1 point.
If your weapon hits a powerup that powerup gets destroyed, even if it is your own.
Opponent's powerups don't appear on your screen, but the light they emit onto the ground does.
Hence you should look for lit up areas on the ground when aiming to destroy your opponent's powerups.

Highly recommended to play with two controllers but playing with one keyboard is possible.

Player 1 - WASD to move, spacebar to throw weapon
Player 2 - Arrow keys to move, right ctrl to throw weapon
